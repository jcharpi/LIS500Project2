      <h2>Welcome to Our LIS 500 Project</h2>
      <p>
        This website is part of our work for <strong>LIS 500: Code & Power</strong> at UW-Madison, a course that explores the ways technology intersects with power, identity, and access. 
        Who builds technology? Who benefits from it? Who gets left out? These are the kinds of questions we’re thinking about as we examine the relationship between technology and society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we explore some of the key ideas from the course, focusing on <strong>intersectionality in tech</strong>—how different identities and social structures shape (and are shaped by) technology. 
        We also highlight a <strong>tech hero</strong>, someone whose work has made an impact in this space.
      </p>
      <h3>What You’ll Find Here:</h3>

        <li><strong>Intersectionality & Tech</strong> – A closer look at how technology reflects and reinforces social structures, and some additional resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Our Tech Hero</strong> – A deep dive into the contributions of Alphonzo Terrell and Marques Brownlee!</li>
        <li> (Maybe more later on?) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is just a starting point. Technology is constantly evolving, and so are the conversations around it. 
        We hope this site sparks new ideas, challenges assumptions, and encourages deeper thinking about the role of technology in shaping our world.

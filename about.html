        <p>Hello, my name is Josh Charpentier, and I'm currently wrapping up my last semester at UW-Madison! 
          I am working on completing a bachelor's degree in both computer science and philosophy. I innitially 
          planned on only pursuing computer science, but ever since my Philosophy 101 class during freshman year, 
          I've been interested in taking more and more. I'm currently taking classes studying Dante's Diving Comedy 
          (LITRANS 253), Bayesian Epistemology (PHILOS 504), Database Systems (CS564) and this class!</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I primarily like to read, go to the gym, and write, or work on coding projects. Some of the 
          more recent books I've read have included <i>I Heard You Paint Houses</i> by Charles Brandt, <i>Little Women</i> 
          by Louisa May Alcott, and <i>Oathbringer</i> by Brandon Sanderson. I would recommend these three to anyone, but 
          my favorite book of all time is definitely <i>The Alchemist</i> by Paulo Coelho.</p>
        <p>
          Another hobby of mine that I am obsessed with is photography, specifically street photography. 
          For those unfamiliar with the term, street photography involves going out and walking around, 
          photographing everyday life and moments. My favorite technology is tied to my passion for authentic photography. 
          Specifically, my favorite technology is called "content credentials" first introduced by camera manufacturer, Leica. 
          Content credentials is a technology that embeds a sort of signature onto the metadata of a photo at the time of its capture. 
          Then, at any point, if AI is used to alter the photo, its content credentials are removed. Not only does this technology 
          mark authentic work but it also allows anyone to see the entire history of a photo's editing and uploading process.

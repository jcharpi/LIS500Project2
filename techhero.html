      <h2>Kaleb's Tech Hero: Alphonzo Terrell</h2>
      <p>
        Alphonzo created the social platform Spill, created to give the LGBTQIA+ community and people of color a safe space to connect with one another, stay updated
        with current affairs and pop culture news. The startup also contributs to raise funds for Black faimiles that were affected by the LA wildfires. This site
        fills a huge gap in the social media market that give marginalized groups a voice, and a safe space to be themselves without feat of being judged or harassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alphonzo went to college at Columbia University in New York, and then worked for ShowTime and Sony, and was the director of digital and social marketing at HBO.
        He then worked at Twitter but was let go after the company was aquired by Elon Musk. This is when he went and created the social platform Spill. Spill is the first
        black-owned social platform and has gained attention from CNN, Essence and GPB.

      <h2>Josh's Tech Hero: Marques Brownlee</h2>
      <p> Marques Brownlee—perhaps better known as MKBHD—is a case study in how identity and opportunity intersect in the tech world. 
        As a Black tech reviewer on YouTube dominating a space where people of color are often sidelined, Brownlee quietly disrupts the 
        implicit biases that shape who we view as “experts” in the field of technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Representation isn’t just about visibility; it’s about rewriting the stories we tell. Take Brownlee’s 2021 interview with Elon 
        Musk: he pressed Tesla’s CEO on racial bias in AI, a topic rarely spotlighted in mainstream tech reviews. But his advocacy goes 
        deeper. In his video "Reflecting on the Color of My Skin", he urged audiences to intentionally support Black creators, warning 
        how algorithms can suppress diverse voices if engagement wavers. He doesn’t just talk about equity—he engineers it. Behind the 
        scenes, Brownlee spotlights his diverse team on his co-produced, second YouTube channel: The Studio. These choices aren’t accidental; they’re subtle lessons for his audience, many of whom work in 
        homogenous tech environments, proving that talent thrives in every community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet Brownlee’s impact isn’t limited to symbolism—it’s systemic. Tech media often treats diversity as a “niche” box to check, 
        but his success defies that framing. With over 18 million subscribers, he’s outcompeted legacy outlets by prioritizing rigor 
        over stereotypes, forcing platforms like YouTube to reckon with their own algorithmic biases. When he mentors rising creators 
        of color or demystifies video production through tutorials, he’s not just sharing tips—he’s redistributing power.

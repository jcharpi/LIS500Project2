      <h2>Profile: Alphonzo Terrell</h2>
      <p>
        Alphonzo created the social platform Spill, created to give the LGBTQIA+ community and people of color a safe space to connect with one another, stay updated
        with current affairs and pop culture news. The startup also contributs to raise funds for Black faimiles that were affected by the LA wildfires. This site
        fills a huge gap in the social media market that give marginalized groups a voice, and a safe space to be themselves without feat of being judged or harassed.

      <h2>Understanding Implicit Bias and Intersectionality</h2>
      <h3>What is Intersectionality?</h3>
      <p>Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences. 
        The events and conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be understood as shaped by one factor. 
        They are generally shaped by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social inequality, 
        people's lives and the organization of power in a given society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis 
        of social division, be it race or gender or class, but my many axes that work together and influence each other. 
        Intersectionality as an analytic tool gives people better access to the complexity of the world and of themselves.</p>
      <p>- Patricia Hill Collins & Sirma Bilge (2016)</p>
      <h4>So what does that really mean?</h4>
      <p>Intersectionality is the idea that a person’s identity—like race, gender, and class—combines in different ways to shape 
        their experiences. It helps us understand how multiple factors influence inequality and society.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3>What does intersectionality have to do with me and my implicit biases?</h3>
      <p>Oftentimes, we can carry unintentional biases within us. These are often shaped by a number of factors touched on 
        in both the Collins & Bilge definition of intersectionality, as well as our more informal one. Simply put, how we are 
        raised, who spend time around, the different socio-economic class we belong to, and more all work together to shape our 
        beliefs and views of the world, even if sometimes those views are in direct opposition of what we outwardly express.</p>
      <p>It can be bit jarring to uncover your implicit biases because they are not always certain to align with what you would hope 
        to see. Still, being aware of the many factors that shape your underlying beliefs can help you facilitate positive change 
        within yourself. Harvard has a great set of impliciat bias tests to help you get started!</p>
